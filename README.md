## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.tarjeta { /* .tarjeta is the card container */
  width: 300px;
  height: 450px; 
  background: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  border-radius: 15px;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  text-align:center;
  overflow: hidden; 
}

```
I feel proud because I practiced Flexbox
``


### Continued development

I’d like to keep practicing by creating layouts based on a picture or very specific requirements, because it helps me understand how each property affects the layout and how to achieve the expected result.
